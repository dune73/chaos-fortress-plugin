# OWASP CRS Plugin
# Plugin name: chaos-fortress-plugin
# Plugin description: Responds with random status codes, optionally also delays and thus breaks the feedback loop for attackers, effectively making adversarial machine learning way harder.
# Rule ID block base: 9,523,000 (range is 1000, thus ID block base +1000)
# Plugin version: 0.9.1

# Generic rule to disable the plugin
#
# Plugins are enabled by default.
#
# They become active by placing them in the plugin folder. It is possible to
# control plugin activation via setting a variable. This can be done in the
# plugin config file here.
#
# The predefined variable name is meant to be "<plugin name>-plugin_enabled".
# For the template-plugin, this means it can be disabled by setting
# tx.template-plugin_enabled=0.
#
# Note that a global setting of this variable overrides the setting here.
# That means the "enabled" variable is only set by this rule if it has not
# been set before.
#
# Feel free to set the variable unconditionally here by replacing the
# SecRule line with an unconditional SecAction statement.
#

# Chaos Fortress Configuration
# ----------------------------
#
# Value: cf_chaos_level
#   Description: Responding in a super chaotic way, may lead to an attacker dismissing 
#     the status code completely. In contrast, relatively few chaotic status code might 
#     give better results with keeping the attackers hooked.
#   Possible values: 
#   - 1 : 90% of requests exceeding anomaly threshold will get a 403, the rest is 
#         a few rare / chaotic status codes
#   - 2 : 50% of requests exceeding anomaly threshold will get a 400/403/404/409 
#         status code, the rest is distributed, giving a chaotic impression
#   - 3 : Wide spread of status codes, resulting in full chaos
#   Default value: 2
#
# Value: cf_random_delay
#   Description: Config value controlling the delaying of responses for requests
#         exceeding anomaly threshold
#   Possible values:
#   - 0 : No random delay
#   - 1 : Random delay for POST requests exceeding anomaly threshold
#   - 2 : Random delay for every request exceeding anomaly threshold
#   Default value: 1
#
# Value: cf_max_delay
#   Description: If cf_random_delay is enabled, then this is the maximum delay in seconds.
#   Possible values:
#   - 0-n 
#   Default value: 10

# Chaos Fortress Sign-Off
# ----------------------------
#
# Chaos Fortress will ruin a service for benign users when they
# face a false positive. It is therefore imperative you clean
# the service from false positives before installing Chaos Fortress.
#
# Cleaning a service from false positives means that there
# are no false positives at all or certainly not more than
# 1 FP in 100K requests. The acceptable rate is up to you.
#
# Please enter your email address into the variable below
# to confirm you have executed this cleaning and you sign off
# Chaos Fortress for use on the server.
#
# Leaving the address variable on its default value will
# lead to a hard fail with status 500 for every request
# of the entire service.
#
# The email address will never be displayed on the service
# and it won't be written into the logs. It remains here
# in the config for informational purposes.
